# Subclassing with class, extends & super

As we see earlier, the final standard approach to achieve **OOP** is just **Prototyple Sturucture** behind the scenes. but even though
we will simulate **OOP** within a **Prototyple** envirenment.

## Create a normal user using Class

```
class userCreator {
  constructor(name, score) {
    this.name = name;
    this.score = score;
  }

  incrementScore() {
    this.score++;
  }

  sayName() {
    console.log("hello", this.name);
  }
}

const user1 = new userCreator("azedine", 10);
user1.sayName();
user1.incrementScore();
console.log(user1.name);
```

`class userCreator`: It's just a function object combo, it has a function bit with the name `constructor`. This doesn't mean too much, it's just a way to run the function in the function object combo. So when we run `userCreator`, we are actually running the `constructor` bit of it. This is how we execute a function in the function object combo, just like before. It all comes down to the concept of **Prototype**. 

=> At the end of the day, it's just a prototype.

**Memory flow:**

In the global execution context (right side), the JavaScript engine creates a function and object (constructor + prototype). The engine immediately attaches the constructor to the function object combo. It also adds `sayName` and `incrementScore` to the `Prototype` of the object in the function object combo.

### User1 lookup journey

When we create a `user1` object, we call a `constructor` function of the class. This function is just a combination of a function and an object (function-object combo). The JavaScript engine creates a new execution context for this process. The `new` keyword automates some work for us: an empty object `this` is created with `__Proto__` set to the **Prototype** object of `userCreator`. Finally, the `this` object is used to set the properties of `name` and `score`, and this object is returned to the `user1` object.

=> `class` make our life more easier than dealing with prototype inheritance.

## Create Paid User

```
class userCreator {
  constructor(name, score) {
    this.name = name;
    this.score = score;
  }

  incrementScore() {
    this.score++;
  }

  sayName() {
    console.log("hello", this.name);
  }
}

// paidUser

class paidUserCreator extends userCreator {
  constructor(paidName, score, accountBalance) {
    super(paidName, score);
    this.accountBalance = accountBalance;
  }

  incrementBalance() {
    this.accountBalance++;
  }
}

const paidUser1 = new paidUserCreator("xperaz", 100, 250);
paidUser1.sayName();
paidUser1.incrementScore();
paidUser1.incrementBalance();

console.log(paidUser1);

```

We begin by defining a new `paidUserCreator` subclass and adding an `accountBalance` property, as well as an `incrementBalance` method. However, there is something new and exciting here!:

**extends**: going to do two major things for us:

1- The first thing extend do is set that `__Proto__` of `paidUserCreator` prototype as a reference up to `userCreator` prototype, before we did it manually but now extend it for us.<br/>
2- The second thing sets the `__Proto__` of `paidUserCreator` function (constructor) to the `userCreator` function object combo.

### Creating an object with a Subclass

**memory flow**:

![](images/img12.png?raw=true)

- After invoking `new paidUserCreator`, a new execution context was created, js will create also an uninitialized `this` object this object gonna burn in `userCreator` and that is a design decision of the javascript team.=> and then it automatically returns it out and assigned it to `this` in `paidUserCreator`.

We use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of the `userCreator` class.

## Super in Subclass constructor.

- `super` calls `userCreator` the same as we called it earlier with `new userCreator`, js engine will create a new execution context, and create an empty object `this` automatically, but this time the `this` keyword will not have `__Proto__` to `userCreator.prototype` as before, instead will override it to have reference to `paidUserCreator.prototype`.

- Behind the scenes **super** uses `Reflect.construct()`,=> After filling user information in `userCreator` the `this` object got returned to our `this` in `paidUserCreator` => after that we add balance property to that user and return `this` object to `paidUser1`.

> [MDN]  
> The `Reflect.construct()` static method is like the `new` operator but as a function. It is equivalent to calling `new target(...args)`.It additionally allows to specify a different `new.target` value.

## Conclusion

Now that we have implemented the Subclassing solution, which is cleaner than our previous prototype-based approach, we have a better understanding of how ((OOP)) works under the hood in JavaScript.
